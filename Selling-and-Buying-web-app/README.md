# Selling-and-Buying-web-app

- We build a renting and buying app which makes the task of renting and buying of a property very easy and makes many people to know about it. 
In  this app we can post any type  of properties like lands , houses or shops which we want to give rent or sell. The users Who want to take 
rent or buy can search through our app and find their best. The owners of Rent houses can also keep track of their monthly payments  in their dashboard. 
The users Can chat with each other or can make phone calls by requesting them to make deals. Users Can also  follow the properties in which they are interested and they will be displayed in their feed.

## Functionality supported :
- There will be some forms to add property details and post it. There will be a sliding menu in which there are options like rents, buys and add property. We can go select add property to post a property to give rent or sell. If we select rents or buys then a list of posts will be displayed and we can search through them using owner name, address ,title etc. If we select an item in those posts then we will go to the post page where all details of post and the related posts of that owner are displayed in bottom of that page and  we can follow the post or like them. If the user is owner of that post then they can edit ,delete or mark it as done. All the followed posts will be reflected in our feed.

In the user profile all the details of user like the posts , sold items, bought items etc will be there and they can manage them. They can edit their profile also for ex.
